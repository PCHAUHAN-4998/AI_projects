#HEART ATTACK RISK PREDICTION
#Heart attacks are becoming more and more commonplace globally, resulting in millions of fatalities year, and this trend is expected to continue. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 17.9 million deaths worldwide were projected to be caused by cardiovascular disease in 2016. This is about 31% of all deaths. 85% of these fatalities were brought on by heart attacks and strokes. Raised blood pressure is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and accounts for over 75% of fatalities from CVDs in low- and middle-income countries.  63% of all deaths in India in 2016 were attributed to NCDs (noncommunicable diseases), with 27% being related to CVDs. The only known approach to reduce the death and morbidity linked to heart attacks is to seek early care. Heart attacks are characterized by the heart stopping suddenly and without warning.  
The heart muscle cannot acquire enough oxygen (O2), which damages the heart tissue, when there is an abrupt blockage in the arteries supplying the heart with blood for life or for any other reason. Plaques are formations made of accumulated substances like fat and cholesterol in the arterial walls that control blood flow. As time goes on, these plaques increase, causing the vessels to constrict and eventually crack, which can result in a heart attack. The use of tobacco, alcohol, drugs, and many other substances that raise blood pressure and fat levels, as well as age (for men over 40 and women over 50) and other major illnesses like diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, chronic stress, heart attacks, and arrhythmias, are significant risk factors in India. Currently, the risk of having a heart attack rises generally after the ages of 40 for men and 50 for women. Women are less likely than men to experience a heart attack, and the elderly and men are more likely to experience a heart attack than other risk factors. To diagnose a HA, doctors and experts frequently employ blood tests, echocardiograms, and electrocardiograms (ECG). The most popular diagnostic technique is electrocardiography (ECG). When a patient has an unhealthy heart, aberrant electrical impulses are captured through electrodes on their chest during the ECG. Thus, the signals will be abnormal if the patient is experiencing a heart attack, making this a late intervention that won't be able to save lives. Furthermore, individual differences in the structure of the heart, as well as past heart conditions, trauma, and surgical procedures like coronary artery bypass grafting, all have an impact on the specificity of the ECG. It cannot, therefore, be a basis for an early diagnosis. Conversely, an echocardiogram uses sound waves and picture creation to assess whether any portion of the heart is injured. Its drawbacks are nearly identical to those of ECG. As a result, these drawbacks make echocardiograms unsuitable as an early diagnosis technique for the identification of HA. Because of their drawbacks, neither of these approaches is recommended, and a doctor's expertise and familiarity with these techniques is the only factor that can determine whether a patient has HA or not.
In contrast, the process of identifying HA signs in blood is quicker, less costly, and more objective. Before a haemoglobin-associated haemorrhage (HA), some proteins and enzymes that can be detected by blood tests, such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), troponin myoglobin, and creatine kinase isoenzymes, slowly permeate the blood. One type of creatine kinase, called CK-MB isoenzyme, is specifically found in heart muscle cells and rises in the blood, particularly in heart conditions. Furthermore, when the heart muscle is injured, as in a heart attack, another cardiac biomarker called troponin is released; the more heart damage, the higher the level of troponin in the blood. It might be able to accurately estimate the risk of HA based on these variations. As a result, a diagnosis can be established in order to identify a HA early and start treatment.
